# Force Grid Pipeline Integration Summary

## Overview
The Force Grid pipeline has been successfully integrated into Fooocus. This feature allows users to generate a single grid image composed of multiple generated images instead of individual separate images.

## Integration Components

### 1. Core Files
- **`extensions/force_grid.py`** - Original force grid implementation that patches the worker execute function
- **`extensions/force_grid_pipeline.py`** - Advanced Force Grid sampler that patches the sampling function
- **`extensions/force_grid_integration.py`** - Integration layer providing a clean interface for Force Grid functionality

### 2. UI Integration
- **`webui.py`** - Added `force_grid_checkbox` to the UI controls
  - Checkbox label: "Generate Grid Image (Experimental)"
  - Located in the main generation controls
  - Properly added to the `ctrls` list for parameter passing

### 3. Task Processing Integration
- **`modules/async_worker.py`** - Updated AsyncTask to handle force_grid_checkbox
  - Added `self.force_grid_checkbox = args.pop()` to properly extract the parameter
  - Added `force_grid_checkbox=async_task.force_grid_checkbox` to process_diffusion call

### 4. Pipeline Integration
- **`modules/default_pipeline.py`** - Updated process_diffusion to handle Force Grid
  - Added `force_grid_checkbox=False` parameter
  - Integrated ForceGridContext for proper activation/deactivation
  - Handles Force Grid enabling/disabling with error handling

## How It Works

### Force Grid Sampler Approach
The main implementation uses `ForceGridSampler` which:
1. Patches the sampling function in `ldm_patched.modules.samplers`
2. Intercepts the sampling results
3. Stitches multiple images into a grid layout
4. Returns a single grid image instead of individual images

### Context Management
Uses `ForceGridContext` for proper lifecycle management:
- Automatically enables Force Grid when entering context
- Restores original state when exiting context
- Handles errors gracefully

### Grid Layout
- Automatically calculates grid size (closest square)
- Pads with duplicate images if needed
- Saves grid to outputs directory with unique naming

## Usage

### For Users
1. Open Fooocus
2. Check the "Generate Grid Image (Experimental)" checkbox
3. Set your desired number of images to generate
4. Generate as normal
5. Output will be a single grid image instead of individual images

### For Developers
```python
# Enable Force Grid programmatically
from extensions.force_grid_integration import enable_force_grid_simple
enable_force_grid_simple()

# Use context manager for temporary activation
from extensions.force_grid_integration import with_force_grid
with with_force_grid():
    # Generate images - will be combined into grid
    result = your_generation_function()

# Check status
from extensions.force_grid_integration import get_force_grid_status
status = get_force_grid_status()
print(status)
```

## Technical Details

### Sampling Function Patching
The Force Grid sampler patches `ldm_patched.modules.samplers.sampling_function` to:
- Intercept sampling results
- Convert tensors/PIL images to consistent format
- Create grid layout
- Return single grid image

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if Force Grid fails to activate
- Automatic restoration of original sampling function
- Comprehensive error logging

### Memory Management
- Efficient image processing
- Proper cleanup of temporary objects
- Minimal memory overhead

## Files Modified

### Core Integration
- `modules/async_worker.py` - Added force_grid_checkbox parameter handling
- `modules/default_pipeline.py` - Added Force Grid context management
- `webui.py` - Added UI checkbox and parameter passing

### Extension Files
- `extensions/force_grid.py` - Original implementation
- `extensions/force_grid_pipeline.py` - Advanced sampler implementation
- `extensions/force_grid_integration.py` - Integration interface

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_force_grid_simple.py`)
- All integration tests pass
- Verified parameter flow from UI to pipeline
- Confirmed proper file structure and code organization

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - Force Grid pipeline is fully integrated and ready for use.

## Notes
- Feature is marked as "Experimental" in the UI
- May cause performance impact on some systems
- Grid images are saved to the standard outputs directory
- Original individual images are not saved when Force Grid is enabled
