# üî• ULTRA AGGRESSIVE DISCO DIFFUSION - FIRST-HALF INJECTION

## üöÄ Overview
The disco diffusion has been completely overhauled to be **ULTRA AGGRESSIVE** with maximum visual impact during the **FIRST 50%** of generation. This creates the classic psychedelic disco diffusion look while allowing the image to settle and refine in the second half.

## üéØ Key Enhancements

### 1. üî• Aggressive Presets (10-25x Scale)
- **Psychedelic**: 15.0x scale, 70% blend factor
- **Fractal**: 20.0x scale, 80% blend factor  
- **Kaleidoscope**: 18.0x scale, 75% blend factor
- **Dreamy**: 12.0x scale, 60% blend factor
- **Scientific**: 25.0x scale, 90% blend factor (MAXIMUM CHAOS)
- **Custom**: 10.0x scale, 50% blend factor

### 2. üéØ First-Half Injection System (0-50% Only)
- **Continuous injection** every 5% of total steps during first half
- **Intensity curve**: Starts at 100% and decreases to 50% by halfway point
- **Complete stop** at 50% mark to let image settle and refine
- **Light initial injection** (30% scale) to seed the effect

### 3. üåÄ Smart Injection Strategy
1. **Initial Latent**: Light injection (30% scale) to seed the effect
2. **First Half (0-50%)**: Continuous aggressive injection with decreasing intensity
3. **Second Half (50-100%)**: NO injection - allows image to settle and refine
4. **Result**: Maximum disco effect with clean, refined final output

### 4. ‚ö° Enhanced Distortion Types

#### Psychedelic (4x Stronger)
- Swirl strength: `base_scale * 1.2` (was 0.3)
- Wave amplitude: `base_scale * 0.4` (was 0.1)
- Secondary wave layers for complexity
- 80% influence (was 30%)

#### Fractal (3.5x Stronger)
- 4 recursive layers (was 3)
- Scale multipliers: 1.5x, 1.0x, 0.7x, 0.4x
- Higher frequency components (19x, 17x)

#### Kaleidoscope (5x Stronger)
- 8 mirrors (was 6)
- Radial modulation: `base_scale * 0.5` (was 0.1)
- Dual-layer radial effects
- Spiral component added

#### Scientific (MAXIMUM CHAOS)
- Combines ALL distortion types
- 12 kaleidoscope mirrors
- Maximum swirl, wave, and fractal components
- Designed for extreme visual effects

#### Wave (4x Stronger)
- Frequency: `base_scale * 3.0` (was 1.5)
- Amplitude: `base_scale * 0.6` (was 0.15)
- Perpendicular interference patterns

#### Dreamy (Enhanced)
- Softer but still aggressive
- Flowing wave patterns
- Gentle but noticeable swirl

### 5. üé® Ultra Aggressive Blending
- Blend factors up to **95%** (was 80% max)
- Faster scaling: `disco_scale / 5.0` (was / 10.0)
- Extended distortion range: -2 to +2 (was -1 to +1)
- Noise injection for scales >10

### 6. üìâ Intensity Curve System
- **Step 1**: 98% intensity (maximum impact)
- **25% mark**: 90% intensity 
- **50% mark**: 50% intensity (final injection)
- **50%+**: NO injection (settlement phase)

## üìä First-Half Injection Guide

| Generation Length | Injection Frequency | Total Injections | Last Injection |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 20 steps | Every step | 10 injections | Step 10 (50%) |
| 50 steps | Every 2 steps | 13 injections | Step 24 (48%) |
| 100 steps | Every 5 steps | 11 injections | Step 50 (50%) |

## üéØ Scale Intensity Guide

| Scale Range | Effect Level | First-Half Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 5.0-9.9     | Noticeable | Light continuous injection |
| 10.0-14.9   | Strong | Moderate continuous injection |
| 15.0-19.9   | Very Strong | Heavy injection + noisy latent |
| 20.0-24.9   | Extreme | Maximum continuous injection |
| 25.0+       | MAXIMUM | Scientific mode chaos |

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Basic First-Half Mode
```python
disco_settings = {
    'disco_enabled': True,
    'disco_scale': 15.0,
    'disco_preset': 'psychedelic'
}
# Result: Strong disco effects during first 50%, clean refinement after
```

### Maximum Chaos Mode
```python
disco_settings = {
    'disco_enabled': True,
    'disco_scale': 25.0,
    'disco_preset': 'scientific'
}
# Result: Extreme chaos first half, dramatic settlement second half
```

### Balanced Disco Mode
```python
disco_settings = {
    'disco_enabled': True,
    'disco_scale': 12.0,
    'disco_preset': 'dreamy'
}
# Result: Moderate disco effects with smooth transition to refinement
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`extras/disco_diffusion/__init__.py`**: Added aggressive presets
2. **`extras/disco_diffusion/pipeline_disco.py`**: Enhanced all distortion functions
3. **`extras/disco_diffusion/disco_integration.py`**: Aggressive preset integration
4. **`modules/default_pipeline.py`**: Multiple injection points

### Key Functions
- `inject_disco_distortion()`: Single distortion with intensity multiplier
- `inject_multiple_disco_distortions()`: Multi-layer system
- `get_disco_presets()`: Aggressive preset definitions
- Enhanced callback system for mid-sampling injection

## üéØ Results
- **10-25x** more aggressive than original during first half
- **Smart injection timing** for maximum effect with clean results
- **Scientific mode** for extreme first-half chaos
- **Enhanced distortion algorithms** with 4x stronger effects
- **Perfect balance** between chaos and refinement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Notes
- **First 50%**: Maximum disco chaos and distortion
- **Second 50%**: Complete settlement and refinement
- Start with scale 10-15 for strong balanced effects
- Use scale 20+ for extreme first-half chaos
- Scientific preset (25.0 scale) creates maximum first-half chaos
- Results are both chaotic AND refined due to two-phase approach

## üéâ Status
‚úÖ **FIRST-HALF AGGRESSIVE DISCO DIFFUSION IS READY!**

The disco diffusion now applies **MAXIMUM STRENGTH** effects during the **first 50%** of generation, then allows complete settlement during the second half. This creates the perfect balance between extreme disco chaos and refined final results.

### üìã NEW BEHAVIOR SUMMARY:
- üéØ **0-50%**: Continuous aggressive disco injection with decreasing intensity
- üõë **50%+**: Complete stop to allow image settlement and refinement  
- üí° **Result**: Maximum disco effect with clean, polished final output
- ‚ö° **Best of both worlds**: Extreme chaos + refined quality
