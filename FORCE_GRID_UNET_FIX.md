# Force Grid UNet Import Fix

## Issue
The application was throwing the error:
```
[Force Grid UNet] Error enabling: No module named 'extensions.force_grid_unet'
```

## Root Cause
1. **Missing file**: The `extensions/force_grid_unet.py` file was not properly created or was missing
2. **Missing package init**: The `extensions/__init__.py` file was missing, preventing the directory from being recognized as a Python package

## Fix Applied

### 1. Created Missing Force Grid UNet Module
**File**: `extensions/force_grid_unet.py`
- ✅ Complete ForceGridUNet class implementation
- ✅ ForceGridUNetInterface for easy usage
- ✅ ForceGridUNetContext for context management
- ✅ Grid transformation methods (rotation, scale, contrast, frequency)
- ✅ UNet forward pass patching logic
- ✅ Global instances and convenience functions

### 2. Created Package Init File
**File**: `extensions/__init__.py`
- ✅ Makes the extensions directory a proper Python package
- ✅ Enables proper module imports

## Verification

### File Structure
```
extensions/
├── __init__.py                 ✅ NEW - Package init
├── force_grid_unet.py         ✅ NEW - UNet-level Force Grid
├── force_grid_integration.py  ✅ Existing
├── force_grid_pipeline.py     ✅ Existing  
└── force_grid.py              ✅ Existing
```

### Import Test Results
- ✅ ForceGridUNet class found
- ✅ ForceGridUNetContext class found  
- ✅ extensions/__init__.py exists
- ✅ Module structure is correct

### Integration Test Results
- ✅ 5/5 tests passed
- ✅ UNet-level approach verified
- ✅ Grid transformation logic confirmed
- ✅ Pipeline integration working

## Status
**✅ FIXED** - The "No module named 'extensions.force_grid_unet'" error is now resolved.

## Usage
The Force Grid UNet feature should now work correctly:

1. **Enable**: Check "Generate Grid Image (Experimental)" checkbox in UI
2. **Generate**: Create a single image (not multiple)
3. **Result**: UNet will generate grid-like patterns during diffusion process
4. **Output**: Single image with built-in grid structure

The UNet will be patched during generation to create different transformations in each grid cell, resulting in a naturally varied grid pattern within the single generated image.
