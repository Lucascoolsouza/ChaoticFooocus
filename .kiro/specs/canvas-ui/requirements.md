# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing Fooocus web UI from a traditional gallery-based interface into an interactive canvas-based interface. Users will be able to generate images directly onto a canvas, manipulate them spatially, regenerate with the same prompts, delete images, and perform various canvas operations. This provides a more visual and intuitive workflow for image generation and management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate images directly onto a canvas interface, so that I can see all my generated images in a spatial layout and manage them visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks generate THEN the system SHALL display the generated image on a canvas at a default position
2. WHEN multiple images are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically position them on the canvas without overlapping
3. WHEN the canvas becomes full THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling or panning capabilities
4. WHEN an image is generated THEN the system SHALL store the original prompt and generation parameters with the image

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with images on the canvas, so that I can organize, manipulate, and manage my generated content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on an image THEN the system SHALL select that image and show selection indicators
2. WHEN the user drags an image THEN the system SHALL move the image to the new position on the canvas
3. WHEN the user right-clicks on an image THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with available actions
4. WHEN the user double-clicks an image THEN the system SHALL show the image in full resolution view
5. WHEN the user selects multiple images THEN the system SHALL allow batch operations on the selected images

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to regenerate images with the same prompt, so that I can create variations or improve upon existing generations without re-entering parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Regenerate" from an image's context menu THEN the system SHALL use the stored prompt and parameters to generate a new image
2. WHEN regenerating THEN the system SHALL place the new image near the original image on the canvas
3. WHEN regenerating THEN the system SHALL preserve all original generation settings including seed, steps, and model parameters
4. WHEN the user modifies the prompt before regenerating THEN the system SHALL use the updated prompt while keeping other parameters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete images from the canvas, so that I can remove unwanted generations and keep my workspace clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Delete" from an image's context menu THEN the system SHALL remove the image from the canvas
2. WHEN the user presses the Delete key with an image selected THEN the system SHALL remove the selected image
3. WHEN deleting multiple selected images THEN the system SHALL remove all selected images at once
4. WHEN an image is deleted THEN the system SHALL free up the canvas space for new images

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing tabs and functionality to work within the canvas mode, so that I can access all current features while using the new interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches to canvas mode THEN the system SHALL maintain access to all existing tabs (Upscale, Image Prompt, Inpaint, etc.)
2. WHEN using inpaint functionality THEN the system SHALL allow selecting a canvas image as the input
3. WHEN using image prompt functionality THEN the system SHALL allow dragging images from the canvas as inputs
4. WHEN using upscale functionality THEN the system SHALL place the upscaled result on the canvas
5. WHEN switching between canvas and traditional modes THEN the system SHALL preserve the current session state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and load canvas sessions, so that I can preserve my work and continue later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Save Canvas" THEN the system SHALL save all images, their positions, and associated metadata
2. WHEN the user clicks "Load Canvas" THEN the system SHALL restore a previously saved canvas state
3. WHEN loading a canvas THEN the system SHALL restore image positions, prompts, and generation parameters
4. WHEN the browser is refreshed THEN the system SHALL automatically save the current canvas state
5. WHEN returning to the application THEN the system SHALL offer to restore the last canvas state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export images from the canvas, so that I can save individual images or collections to my local system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Export" from an image's context menu THEN the system SHALL download the image file
2. WHEN the user selects multiple images and chooses "Export Selected" THEN the system SHALL download all selected images as a zip file
3. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL preserve the original image quality and format
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include metadata in the filename or as separate files if requested

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to zoom and pan the canvas, so that I can work with large collections of images and see details clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user uses the mouse wheel THEN the system SHALL zoom in or out of the canvas
2. WHEN the user drags on empty canvas space THEN the system SHALL pan the view
3. WHEN zooming THEN the system SHALL maintain the center point of the zoom operation
4. WHEN the canvas is zoomed THEN the system SHALL show zoom level indicators
5. WHEN the user clicks "Fit to Screen" THEN the system SHALL adjust zoom to show all images

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback and status indicators on the canvas, so that I can understand the state of my images and ongoing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is being generated THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator at the target canvas position
2. WHEN an image is selected THEN the system SHALL show selection borders and handles
3. WHEN an image has an error THEN the system SHALL show error indicators and allow retry
4. WHEN hovering over an image THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with generation parameters
5. WHEN images are being processed THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts for canvas operations, so that I can work efficiently with the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+A THEN the system SHALL select all images on the canvas
2. WHEN the user presses Delete THEN the system SHALL delete selected images
3. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+Z THEN the system SHALL undo the last canvas operation
4. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+S THEN the system SHALL save the current canvas state
5. WHEN the user presses Space+drag THEN the system SHALL pan the canvas view
